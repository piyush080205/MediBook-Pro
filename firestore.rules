/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for MediBook Pro.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and appointments,
 * while allowing public read access to doctor and clinic information. Write access to
 * certain collections (triage logs, slot optimization logs, queue history) is restricted
 * to the application backend to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized modifications.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}: Stores doctor profiles, publicly readable but write-protected.
 * - /clinics/{clinicId}: Stores clinic information, publicly readable but write-protected.
 * - /users/{userId}/appointments/{appointmentId}: Stores appointment bookings, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /triage_logs/{triageLogId}: Stores triage logs, write-protected.
 * - /slot_optimization_logs/{slotOptimizationLogId}: Stores slot optimization logs, write-protected.
 * - /queue_history/{queueHistoryId}: Stores queue history, write-protected.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Doctor and clinic information is publicly readable to facilitate discovery.
 * - Write access to triage, slot optimization, and queue history logs is restricted to the backend.
 * - All destructive operations (update, delete) require verifying the document's existence.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Appointment` entity denormalizes the `userId` to allow direct rule-based access control.
