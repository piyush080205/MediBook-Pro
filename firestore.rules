/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for MediBook Pro.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data (e.g., appointments),
 * allows public read access to doctor and clinic information, and restricts write access to specific roles or owners.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Users: `/users/{userId}` (owner-only access)
 * - Doctors: `/doctors/{doctorId}` (public read, owner-only write - TODO: needs ownership field)
 * - Clinics: `/clinics/{clinicId}` (public read, owner-only write - TODO: needs ownership field)
 * - Appointments: `/users/{userId}/appointments/{appointmentId}` (owner-only access to appointments nested under the user)
 * - Triage Logs: `/triage_logs/{triageLogId}` (open writes for fast prototyping)
 * - Slot Optimization Logs: `/slot_optimization_logs/{slotOptimizationLogId}` (open writes for fast prototyping)
 * - Queue History: `/queue_history/{queueHistoryId}` (open writes for fast prototyping)
 * - OtpCache: `/otp_cache/{phone}` (owner-only write)
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed.
 * - Doctor and Clinic information is publicly readable. Write access is currently open, but should be restricted to authorized roles or owners in production.
 * - OtpCache are phone number owned
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset avoids `get()` calls by assuming that necessary authorization data (e.g., user IDs)
 * is either present in the `request.auth` context or denormalized directly onto the documents being secured.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Private user data (appointments) is stored in user subcollections, while public data (doctors, clinics) is stored in top-level collections.
